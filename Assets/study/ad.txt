Hello, 

I am currently looking for some volunteers to take part in a study of UI interaction on an HTC Vive XR Elite device.

⏳ The study will take about half an hour, including trying out the demo and filling out the questionnaire afterwards. 

📍 The study will take place in our lab, R08 in the old main building

🍬 Thank you for considering this opportunity! There will also be some sweets for you to grab~
